  	And the following admins exist
  	 | name  | email                  |
  	 | Bob   | supreme_ruler@aol.com  |
    And the following discussions exist
   	 | number  | time         |  capacity |
   	 | 54321   | Tues, 3pm    |  25       |
  	And I am on the login page
    And I log in as an admin with email "supreme_ruler@aol.com"
  	And the team with passcode "penguindrool" is approved with discussion number "54321"

  Scenario: An admin successfully downloads approved team information
    Given I follow "Download this data"
  	Then I should have downloaded a team information file
